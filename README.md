## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Why bother migrate?

Reasons to migrate:
- We can have all the new features and corrected bugs of previous versions  
- The AOT builds will be noticeably faster ensuring a significant change in the compiler's performance.  
- The Angular framework in the new version uses unique techniques and tools to debug its applications by themselves.  
- With IVY we see an improvement in the build error. It gives less time for the builds to complete enabling all the error messages easier to read.
